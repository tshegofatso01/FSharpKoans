What's a match expression?  It's a construct that uses the power of patterns
to conditionally execute code.  The first pattern (going from top to bottom) that
matches causes the associated code to be executed.  All non-matching patterns,
and any patterns after the first matching pattern, are ignored.  If no pattern
matches, then you get a MatchFailureException at runtime and you turn into a
Sad Panda...
